## Getting Started

To get started with BlazorBlocks, follow these steps:

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio
3. Build and run the project

In the future, the project will be available as a nuget package.
As we're not at a stable release yet, we recommend cloning the repository and building the project yourself.

BlazorBlocks provides an intuitive interface for creating and editing web page content. Here's how you can use it:
